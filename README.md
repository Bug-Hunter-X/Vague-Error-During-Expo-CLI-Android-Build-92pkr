# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Vague Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Android APKs using Expo CLI. The build process fails with a generic error message, lacking specific details to assist in debugging.  This makes troubleshooting time-consuming and challenging.

## Problem

The Expo CLI build process for Android unexpectedly terminates, producing an error message that's too general to diagnose the underlying problem. The log output, while extensive, may not identify the root cause.

## Solution

This repo provides a potential workaround (though the exact solution depends on the specific cause of your error): focus on meticulously checking the Android configuration and dependencies,  carefully examining the full build log for more specific clues, and trying alternative build strategies (e.g., EAS Build).
