The exact solution depends on the root cause.  The following steps can help diagnose the issue:

1. **Examine the complete build log:** The full log may contain clues hidden within the seemingly vague initial error message. Search for specific error messages or warnings related to dependencies, Gradle, or Android build tools.
2. **Check Android dependencies:** Verify all your Android dependencies are compatible and correctly specified in your `package.json` and `app.json` files. Ensure that there are no version conflicts or missing dependencies.  Pay close attention to native modules or libraries.
3. **Clean and rebuild:** Before attempting another build, use the Expo CLI's clean command to remove existing build artifacts. Then, rebuild your application to see if the problem is resolved.
4. **Update dependencies:**  Outdated dependencies can sometimes contribute to unexpected build behavior. Make sure all your packages, including Expo itself, are up-to-date.
5. **Use EAS Build:** If direct builds with Expo CLI consistently fail, try using Expo's EAS Build service. EAS Build may handle build complexities more effectively.
6. **Check for errors in native Android code:** If you've integrated native Android code, verify that it's correctly implemented and free of errors. 
7. **Enable verbose logging:** Increase logging verbosity during the build process to capture more detailed information that could shed light on the problem.
